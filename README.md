# Foodie Plan and Travel Route Visualization

This project aims to help you explore local food trucks, generate a two-day weekend foodie plan, visualize travel routes, analyze food truck data, and present data visualizations. The project includes multiple Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Components

### Data Collection

- **food_truck_requests.py**: Collects data on local food trucks using the Google Places API.
- **Dependencies**: `requests`, `pandas`

### Data Cleaning and Organization

- **data_cleaning.ipynb**: Cleans and organizes collected food truck data.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`

### Data Analysis and Visualization

- **visulations.py**: Generates data visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, a pie chart, and a heatmap.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`

### Foodie Plan

- **food_plan.py**: Creates a two-day weekend foodie plan, including time, location, cuisine, travel time, travel distance, and transportation type.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`, `random`

### Travel Route Visualization

- **travel_route.py**: Builds a visualization of the travel route between food truck locations using interactive maps.
- **Dependencies**: `geopy`, `folium`
